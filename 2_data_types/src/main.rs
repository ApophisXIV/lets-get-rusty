    // {} is called interpolation and it is used to print variables inside a string or a format string. The difference between {} and {:?} is that {:?} prints the value of the variable and {} prints the type of the variable.
    // {:?} is a pretty printer for debuging purposes. The difference between {:?} and {:#?} is that {:?} prints the values of the variables, while {:#?} prints the type of the variables.
    println!("The value of a3 is: {:?}", a3); //Prints the array in a nice way
